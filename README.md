# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-Machine-Learning

## 📖 Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most common life-threatening diseases among women worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis significantly improves survival rates.

This project implements a **machine learning–based classification system** that predicts whether a breast tumor is:
- **Malignant (Cancerous)**
- **Benign (Non-cancerous)**

The system acts as a **decision-support tool** to assist medical professionals by providing reliable secondary analysis.
